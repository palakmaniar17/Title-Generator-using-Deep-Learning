# Title-Generator-using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of generating titles for YouTube videos. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words, employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. This README file provides an overview of the project, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and testing, along with insights from the resulting analysis and future scope.

Data Collection and Preprocessing

    Data Collection: Collect YouTube video data including titles, views, likes, and dislikes.
    Preprocessing: Clean the text data, tokenize it, and generate sequences suitable for LSTM training. This involves:
        Tokenization
        Padding sequences

Model Training

    Architecture: The model employs an LSTM architecture to learn sequential patterns in text data.
    Training: The training process involves:
        Defining the LSTM model
        Training the model on the preprocessed sequences
        Saving the trained model for future use

Evaluation and Results

    Correlation Analysis:
        Analyzed the relationship between:
            Likes and views
            Dislikes and views
            Likes and dislikes
        Observed positive correlations, particularly stronger between likes and views.

    Model Performance:
        Evaluated the model's ability to generate coherent titles based on seed texts.
        Demonstrated potential applications in natural language processing tasks.

Challenges Faced

    Computational Resources:
        High memory usage during training
        CPU/GPU overloads leading to potential system crashes

    Time-Consuming:
        Long training times, particularly with deep neural networks
        Multiple iterations for hyperparameter tuning

    System Crashes:
        Insufficient RAM during simultaneous experiments
        Resource contention causing issues
